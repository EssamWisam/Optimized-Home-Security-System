# ðŸ”’ Optimized-Home-Security-System ðŸ”“

This is more than just an HDL implementation of a home security system as described <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/18rDqqMPJ92Zvj2uLoiFOA75uY_x9RtKI/view?usp=sharing">here</a>. We considered various implentations for the system and ran both the frontend (synthesis) and backend flows (floorplanning, routing, placemenet) and compared their performance, area and power before settling on the best design. 

For more info, statisitics, netlists and simulations at different points of the flow, check the PDF.
